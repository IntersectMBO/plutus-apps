description:
    A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double
    precision floating point and text.
    .
    This library is implemented as bindings to the C++
    @double-conversion@ library written by Florian Loitsch at Google:
    <https://github.com/floitsch/double-conversion>.
    .
    The 'Text' versions of these functions are about 30 times faster
    than the default 'show' implementation for the 'Double' type.
    .
    The 'ByteString' versions are /slower/ than the 'Text' versions;
    roughly half the speed.  (This seems to be due to the cost of
    allocating 'ByteString' values via @malloc@.)
    .
    As a final note, be aware that the @bytestring-show@ package is
    about 50% slower than simply using 'show'.
