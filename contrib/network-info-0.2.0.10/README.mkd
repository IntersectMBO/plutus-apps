network-info
=============

This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
networking configuration. It is currently capable of getting a list of
all the network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
addresses.

Compatibility
--------------

network-info has been tested and is known to work on Ubuntu 10.10, Mac
OS X 10.6.4, FreeBSD 9.0 and Windows XP/7. It probably works on other
flavours of Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
