{-
/N.B./, There's a bug when trying to use Cabal-style MIN_VERSION_foo(1,2,3)
macros in combination with hsc2hs. We don't need full hsc2hs support
in this file, but if we use CPP instead we get a strange error on
OSX 10.5.8 about "architecture not supported" (even though the
headers work fine with hsc2hs). It turns out that we don't /need/
to combine Cabal-style macros and hsc2hs\/cpp since we can remove
our dependency on the @unix@ package. But this issue is worth making
a note of.
-}

-- GHC 7.6 changed the semantics of the FFI so that we must have
-- the data constructors in scope in order to import functions using
-- the given types. However, those data constructors[1] are not exported
-- in earlier versions, so having @(..)@ will raise warnings on old
-- systems. However, Cabal-style MIN_VERSION_foo(1,2,3) macros don't
-- play nicely with hsc2hs; and we need hsc2hs in lieu of CPP for
-- OS X. So we disable -Wall rather than trying to CPP this problem
-- away. There doesn't appear to be a -fno-warn-foo for this
-- particular issue.

-- This version takes a kind of stateful predicate for whether and
-- how long to keep retrying. Assume the function is called as
-- @fdReads f z0 fd n0@. We will attempt to read @n0@ bytes from
-- @fd@. If we fall short, then we will call @f len z@ where @len@
-- is the total number of bytes read so far and @z@ is the current
-- state (initially @z0@). If it returns @Nothing@ then we will
-- give up and return the current buffer; otherwise we will retry
-- with the new state, continuing from where we left off.
--
-- For example, to define a function that tries up to @n@ times,
-- we can use:
--
-- > fdReadUptoNTimes :: Int -> Fd -> ByteCount -> IO ByteString
-- > fdReadUptoNTimes n0 = fdReads retry n0
-- >     where
-- >     retry _ 0 = Nothing
-- >     retry _ n = Just $! n-1
--
-- The benefit of doing this instead of the naive approach of calling
-- 'fdRead' repeatedly is that we only need to allocate one byte
-- buffer, and trim it once at the end--- whereas the naive approach
-- would allocate a buffer, trim it to the number of bytes read,
-- and then concatenate with the previous one (another allocation,
-- plus copying everything over) for each time around the loop.
