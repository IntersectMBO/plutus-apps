-- $variance
--
-- The variance&#8212;and hence the standard deviation&#8212;of a
-- sample of fewer than two elements are both defined to be zero.

-- $robust
--
-- These functions use the compensated summation algorithm of Chan et
-- al. for numerical robustness, but require two passes over the
-- sample data as a result.
--
-- Because of the need for two passes, these functions are /not/
-- subject to stream fusion.

-- $cancellation
--
-- The functions prefixed with the name @fast@ below perform a single
-- pass over the sample data using Knuth's algorithm. They usually
-- work well, but see below for caveats. These functions are subject
-- to array fusion.
--
-- /Note/: in cases where most sample data is close to the sample's
-- mean, Knuth's algorithm gives inaccurate results due to
-- catastrophic cancellation.
