# The flake.nix is the entrypoint of all nix code.
#
# This repository uses the standard tool https://github.com/divnix/std.
# Familiarity with std is required to be able to contribute effectively.
# While official documentation for std can be found in its GitHub, this flake
# has been thoroughly commented so as to quickstart new maintainers.
# This flake can also be used as a template for new std-based projects.
# Further documentation can be found in nix/README.md
#
# You may want to refer to the standard glossary as you go along:
# https://divnix.github.io/std/glossary.html

        # Each cell block must be either:
        #   A nix file named after the cell block
        #   A directory named after the cell block and containing a default.nix

        #     Jobsets for our Hydra CI
        #
        # std provides a TUI to interact with the cell blocks.
