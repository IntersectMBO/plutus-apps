  -- NOTE: choosing a MVar is a tradeoff towards simplicity. In this case a
  -- (bounded) queue could perform better. Indeed a properly-sized buffer
  -- can reduce the time the two threads are blocked waiting for each
  -- other. The problem here is "properly-sized". A bounded queue like
  -- Control.Concurrent.STM.TBQueue allows us to specify a max queue length
  -- but block size can vary a lot (TODO quantify this) depending on the
  -- era. We have an alternative implementation with customizable queue
  -- size (TBMQueue) but it needs to be extracted from the
  -- plutus-chain-index-core package. Using a simple MVar doesn't seem to
  -- slow down marconi's indexing, likely because the difference is
  -- negligeable compared to existing network and IO latencies.  Therefore,
  -- let's stick with a MVar now and revisit later.
