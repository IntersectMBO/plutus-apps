-- | This module provides a framework for testing Plutus contracts built on "Test.QuickCheck". The
--   testing is model based, so to test a contract you define a type modelling the state of the
--   contract (or set of contracts) and provide an instance of the `ContractModel` class. This
--   instance specifies what operations (`Action`s) the contract supports, how they interact with
--   the model state, and how to execute them in the blockchain emulator ("Plutus.Trace.Emulator").
--   Tests are evaluated by running sequences of actions (random or user-specified) in the emulator
--   and comparing the state of the blockchain to the model state at the end.
--
--   Test cases are written in the `DL` monad, which supports mixing fixed sequences of actions with
--   random actions, making it easy to write properties like
--   /it is always possible to get all funds out of the contract/.

-- The `Spec` monad is used in the `nextState` function to specify how the model state is affected
-- by each action.
--
-- Note that the model state does not track the absolute `balances` of each wallet, only how the
-- balance changes over the execution of a contract. Thus, token transfers (using `transfer`,
-- `deposit` or `withdraw`) always succeed in the model, but might fail when running the
-- contract in the emulator, causing test failures. The simplest way to deal with this is
-- to make sure that each wallet has enough starting funds to cover any scenario encountered during
-- testing. The starting funds can be provided in the `CheckOptions` argument to
-- `propRunActionsWithOptions`.
-- Another option is to model the starting funds of each contract in the contract state and check
-- that enough funds are available before performing a transfer.

-- $dynamicLogic
--
-- Test scenarios are described in the `DL` monad (based on dynamic logic) which lets you freely mix
-- random sequences of actions (`anyAction`, `anyActions_`, `anyActions`) with specific
-- actions (`action`). It also supports checking properties of the model state (`DL.assert`,
-- `assertModel`), and random generation (`DL.forAllQ`).
--
-- For instance, a unit test for a simple auction contract might look something like this:
--
-- @
--  unitTest :: `DL` AuctionState ()
--  unitTest = do
--      `action` $ Bid w1 100
--      `action` $ Bid w2 150
--      `action` $ Wait endSlot
--      `action` $ Collect
-- @
--
--  and could easily be extended with some randomly generated values
--
-- @
--  unitTest :: `DL` AuctionState ()
--  unitTest = do
--      bid <- `forAllQ` $ `chooseQ` (1, 100)
--      `action` $ Bid w1 bid
--      `action` $ Bid w2 (bid + 50)
--      `action` $ Wait endSlot
--      `action` $ Collect
-- @
--
-- More interesting scenarios can be constructed by mixing random and fixed sequences. The following
-- checks that you can always finish an auction after which point there are no funds locked by the
-- contract:
--
-- @
-- finishAuction :: `DL` AuctionState ()
-- finishAuction = do
--   `anyActions_`
--   `action` $ Wait endSlot
--   `action` $ Collect
--   `assertModel` "Funds are locked!" (`Ledger.Value.isZero` . `lockedValue`)
-- @
--
-- `DL` scenarios are turned into QuickCheck properties using `forAllDL`.

-- $dynamicLogic_errors
--
-- In addition to failing the check that the emulator run matches the model, there are a few other
-- ways that test scenarios can fail:
--
-- * an explicit `action` does not satisfy its `precondition`
-- * a failed `DL.assert` or `assertModel`, or a monad `fail`
-- * an `Control.Applicative.empty` set of `Control.Applicative.Alternative`s
-- * the scenario fails to terminate (see `stopping`)
--
-- All of these occur at test case generation time, and thus do not directly say anything about the
-- contract implementation. However, together with the check that the model agrees with the emulator
-- they indirectly imply properties of the implementation. An advantage of this is that `DL` test
-- scenarios can be checked without running the contract through the emulator, which is much much
-- faster. For instance,
--
-- @
-- prop_FinishModel = `forAllDL` finishAuction $ const True
-- @
--
-- would check that the model does not think there will be any locked funds after the auction is
-- finished. Once this property passes, one can run the slower property that also checks that the
-- emulator agrees.

-- | The monad for writing test scenarios. It supports non-deterministic choice through
--   `Control.Applicative.Alternative`, failure with `MonadFail`, and access to the model state
--   through `GetModelState`. It is lazy, so scenarios can be potentially infinite, although the
--   probability of termination needs to be high enough that concrete test cases are always finite.
--   See `stopping` for more information on termination.
type DL state = DL.DL (ModelState state)

-- | Generate a specific action. Fails if the action's `precondition` is not satisfied.
action :: ContractModel state => Action state -> DL state ()
action cmd = do
  s <- getModelState
  DL.action (contractAction s cmd)

-- | Generate a specific action. Fails if the action's `precondition` is not satisfied.
waitUntilDL :: ContractModel state => Slot -> DL state ()
waitUntilDL = DL.action . WaitUntil

-- | Generate a random action using `arbitraryAction`. The generated action is guaranteed to satisfy
--   its `precondition`. Fails with `Stuck` if no action satisfying the precondition can be found
--   after 100 attempts.
anyAction :: DL state ()
anyAction = DL.anyAction

-- | Generate a sequence of random actions using `arbitraryAction`. All actions satisfy their
--   `precondition`s. The argument is the expected number of actions in the sequence chosen from a
--   geometric distribution, unless in the `stopping` stage, in which case as few actions as
--   possible are generated.
anyActions :: Int -> DL state ()
anyActions = DL.anyActions

-- | Generate a sequence of random actions using `arbitraryAction`. All actions satisfy their
--   `precondition`s. Actions are generated until the `stopping` stage is reached.
anyActions_ :: DL state ()
anyActions_ = DL.anyActions_

-- | Test case generation from `DL` scenarios have a target length of the action sequence to be
--   generated that is based on the QuickCheck size parameter (see `sized`). However, given that
--   scenarios can contain explicit `action`s it might not be possible to stop the scenario once the
--   target length has been reached.
--
--   Instead, once the target number of actions have been reached, generation goes into the
--   /stopping/ phase. In this phase branches starting with `stopping` are preferred, if possible.
--   Conversely, before the stopping phase, branches starting with `stopping`
--   are avoided unless there are no other possible choices.
--
--   For example, here is the definition of `anyActions_`:
--
-- @
-- `anyActions_` = `stopping` `Control.Applicative.<|>` (`anyAction` >> `anyActions_`)
-- @
--
--   The effect of this definition is that the second branch will be taken until the desired number
--   of actions have been generated, at which point the `stopping` branch will be taken and
--   generation stops (or continues with whatever comes after the `anyActions_` call).
--
--   Now, it might not be possible, or too hard, to find a way to terminate a scenario. For
--   instance, this scenario has no finite test cases:
--
-- @
-- looping = `anyAction` >> looping
-- @
--
--   To prevent test case generation from looping, if a scenario has not terminated after generating
--   @2 * n + 20@ actions, where @n@ is when the stopping phase kicks in, generation fails with a
--   `Looping` error.
stopping :: DL state ()
stopping = DL.stopping

-- | By default, `Control.Applicative.Alternative` choice (`Control.Applicative.<|>`) picks among
--   the next actions with equal probability. So, for instance, this code chooses between the actions
--   @a@, @b@ and @c@, with a probability @1/3@ of choosing each:
--
-- @
-- unbiasedChoice a b c = `action` a `Control.Applicative.<|>` `action` b `Control.Applicative.<|>` `action` c
-- @
--
--   To change this you can use `weight`, which multiplies the
--   relative probability of picking a branch by the given number.
--
--   For instance, the following scenario picks the action @a@ with probability @2/3@ and the action
--   @b@ with probability @1/3@:
--
-- @
-- biasedChoice a b = `weight` 2 (`action` a) `Control.Applicative.<|>` `weight` (`action` b)
-- @
--
--   Calls to `weight` need to appear at the top-level after a choice, preceding any actions
--   (`action`/`anyAction`) or random generation (`forAllQ`), or they will have no effect.
weight :: Double -> DL state ()
weight = DL.weight

-- | The `monitor` function allows you to collect statistics of your testing using QuickCheck
--   functions like `Test.QuickCheck.label`, `Test.QuickCheck.collect`, `Test.QuickCheck.classify`,
--   and `Test.QuickCheck.tabulate`. See also the `monitoring` method of `ContractModel` which is
--   called for all actions in a test case (regardless of whether they are generated by an explicit
--   `action` or an `anyAction`).

-- | Turn a `DL` scenario into a QuickCheck property. Generates a random `Actions` matching the
--   scenario and feeds it to the given property. The property can be a full property running the
--   emulator and checking the results, defined using `propRunActions_`, `propRunActions`, or
--   `propRunActionsWithOptions`. Assuming a model for an auction contract and `DL` scenario that
--   checks that you can always complete the auction, you can write:
--
-- @
-- finishAuction :: `DL` AuctionState ()
-- prop_Auction  = `propRunActions_` handles
--   where handles = ...
-- prop_Finish = `forAllDL` finishAuction prop_Auction
-- @
--
--   However, there is also value in a property that does not run the emulator at all:
--
-- @
-- prop_FinishModel = `forAllDL` finishAuction $ const True
-- @
--
--   This will check all the assertions and other failure conditions of the `DL` scenario very
--   quickly. Once this property passes a large number of tests, you can run the full property
--   checking that the model agrees with reality.

-- $quantify
--
-- `DL` scenarios support random generation using `DL.forAllQ`. This does not take a normal
-- QuickCheck `Gen` generator, but a `DL.Quantification`, which aside from a generator also keeps
-- track of which values can be generated. This means test cases coming from scenarios containing
-- `DL.forAll` can be prevented from shrinking to something that could not have been generated in
-- the first place.


-- $runningProperties
--
-- Once you have a `ContractModel` and some `DL` scenarios you need to turn these into QuickCheck
-- properties that can be run by `quickCheck`. The functions `propRunActions_`, `propRunActions`, and
-- `propRunActionsWithOptions` take a sequence of actions (a `Actions`), runs it through the
-- blockchain emulator ("Plutus.Trace.Emulator") and checks that the model and the emulator agree
-- on who owns what tokens at the end.
--
-- To generate a `Actions` you can use the `Arbitrary` instance, which generates a random sequence of
-- actions using `arbitraryAction`, or you can use `forAllDL` to generate a `Actions` from a `DL`
-- scenario.

{- Note [The Env contract]

 In order to get the environment that maps symbolic variables to actual
 tokens out of the emulator we need to use a contract and the `instanceOutcome`
 fold. All this contract does is it materialises the `AssetMap` that we carry
 around inside the emulator.

 At the end of an emulator execution in which we want to check a property
 of the symbolic tokens we need to add a call to to the `register-token-env`
 endpoint and make sure that the `getEnvContract` is running.

-- $noLockedFunds
-- Showing that funds can not be locked in the contract forever.

-- | A "proof" that you can always recover the funds locked by a contract. The first component is
--   a strategy that from any state of the contract can get all the funds out. The second component
--   is a strategy for each wallet that from the same state, shows how that wallet can recover the
--   same (or bigger) amount as using the first strategy, without relying on any actions being taken
--   by the other wallets.
--
--   For instance, in a two player game where each player bets some amount of funds and the winner
--   gets the pot, there needs to be a mechanism for the players to recover their bid if the other
--   player simply walks away (perhaps after realising the game is lost). If not, it won't be
--   possible to construct a `NoLockedFundsProof` that works in a state where both players need to
--   move before any funds can be collected.

    -- of operations have a small but predictable effect on the value collected by different wallets.

--   wallets, and the test then asks each `nlfpWalletStrategy` to show how to recover their
--   allotment of funds without any assistance from the other wallets (assuming the main strategy
--   did not execute). When executing wallet strategies, the off-chain instances for other wallets
--   are killed and their private keys are deleted from the emulator state.
