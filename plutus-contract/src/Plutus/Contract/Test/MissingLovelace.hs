-- | Returns the calculated delta between initial and final values. Might be false positive.
--
-- The tests check if a wallet's funds are equal to some expected value at the end.
-- Unfortunately, because of the adjustion of transactions, the outputs' costs change
-- and it's hard to track these changes in the tests layer.
--
-- This function tries to check if the difference between final and initial values ('realDelta')
-- is a result of combination of operations between output's costs and the expected delta.
--
-- There is a risk when expected delta has only ada part and expected delta /= realDelta
-- and realDelta is divisible by some delta from deltas, then we will return realDelta's ada.
-- Which means that the test will pass but without strong confidence in wallets' funds consistency.
-- For example, we expected -n, but there is n among deltas and realDelta is n,
-- it is divisible by n, then the test will pass. So please be careful.
