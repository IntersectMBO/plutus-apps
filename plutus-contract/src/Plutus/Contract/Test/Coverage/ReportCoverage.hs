-- A "swipe" represents colouring a region of a file with a

-- This surprising ordering on swipes has the property that if s1 is
-- nested within s2, then s1 <= s2. Given that no two swipes overlap,
-- then s1 <= s2 precisely if s1 precedes s2 entirely, or s1 is nested
-- within s2. It follow that, in a sorted list of swipes, the first
-- one has no other swipes nested within it, and therefore its colour
-- takes priority over all other swipes. We make use of this in
-- converting a set of swipes to a set of disjoint swipes with the
