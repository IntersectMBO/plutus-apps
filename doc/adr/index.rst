Architectural Decision Records
==============================

This section stores the architectural decision records.

From  `Architecture decision record (ADR) examples for software planning, IT leadership, and template documentation <joel_>`_, by Joel Parker Henderson:

  - An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

  - An architectural decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

  - An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.

  - A decision log is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

  - All these are within the topic of architectural knowledge management (AKM).
