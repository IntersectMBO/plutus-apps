{-
   This is a simplified indexer implementation. The simplification is that all events,
   points, queries and results have type `Int`.

   The testing infrastructure is designed for the previous version of indexers. There
   is a concern that it does not cover properly the current version, but on further
   thinking it is good enough. The bugs found while implementing it seem to point to
   the same conclusion. However, a lot of the code deals with peculiarites that need
   to be considered when adapting the two models.

   in the original model and the rules surrounding rewinds in the adapter version.
