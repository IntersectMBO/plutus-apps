= Maintenance mode

As our team is focused on other projects and the monorepo approach of this
repository made it hard to maintain, we have decided to stop upgrading the
content of this directory and to pass it in maintenance mode.

Note that this decision doesn't impact at all
https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus[Plutus] the core language of Cardano,
nor https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-tx[Plutus-tx]
the Haskell dialect to write Plutus contract. Both are still actively
developed.

Parts of this repository will probably been spinned-out into their own project,
as we have done with the
https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-emulator[Cardano-node-emulator],
which gives you access to an emulated node that follows the same validation rule
as a real node, or https://github.com/input-output-hk/marconi[Marconi], a
library to define and run custom indexers.

What is maintenance mode? In maintenance mode, no new feature will be actively
developed by the team and we won't upgrade the existing dependencies.
We'll welcome PR and we will review them though and we will do minor bug fixes.

== Introduction

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/policy-Cardano%20Engineering%20Handbook-informational[link=https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook]

The Plutus Application Framework, part of the Plutus Platform, is a framework for developing distributed applications using the Cardano blockchain.
For more information about the projects, see the <<user-documentation>>.

This repository contains:

* Plutus Platform
** Libraries which implement the Plutus Application Framework, a framework for writing applications that work with Cardano.
** A selection of end-to-end usecases written with the Plutus Application Framework

[IMPORTANT]
====
The rest of this README is focussed on people who want to develop or contribute to the Framework.

For people who want to *use* the Framework, please consult the <<user-documentation>>.

== Branching, Versioning and Releases

There are two protected development branches in `plutus-apps`: `main` and `next-node`.
We adopt the PVP versioning scheme.
Check out link:doc/BRANCHING-AND-RELEASE.adoc[Branching Policy and Release Process] to learn more.

=== Dependency update

The dependency update policy is dependent on the protected branch.

For `cardano-node`, we define major-version-bound the range of versions which are compatible with a specific era.
For example, for the Alonzo era, that would be `>= 1.29 && < 1.35`. For the Vasil era, that would be `>= 1.35 && < 1.36`.

Independently of the protected branch:

* It should always use the same first-major-version of `plutus` as the one used by the `plutus` dependency of `cardano-node`
* It should always be safe to upgrade to a new second-major-version of `plutus`: at worst this will lead to some code breakage.
* It should, unless specified otherwise, use the same version for transitive dependencies (`cardano-ledger`, `ouroboros-network`, etc.) with `cardano-node`
* It should pin the major version of `cardano-node` for all packages
* It should pin the first and second-major version of `plutus` for all packages

`main` branch:

* It should not update `cardano-node` to a new major-version. In other words, it should use a `cardano-node` version which is compatible with the current Cardano mainnet
* It should use a `cardano-wallet` version which is compatible with the current `cardano-node` version

`next-node` branch:

* It may update the `cardano-node` to a new major-version. In other words, it may use a `cardano-node` version which is incompatible with the current Cardano mainnet
* It may use a `cardano-wallet` version which is incompatible with the current `cardano-node` version

=== Version ranges

Packages which depend on `plutus-apps` packages should use version ranges to control which version of those packages they build against.

* Packages in `plutus-apps` which are used downstream should pin the major-version of each other (e.g. `plutus-pab-1.0.1` should depend on `plutus-contract ^>= 1.0`).
* Downstream packages should pin at least the first-major-version of `plutus-apps` packages.
** Upgrading to a new second-major-version should always be safe for working on the current mainnet, with at most code breakage (following the PVP). Users may of course want to pin this version as well to avoid such breakage.
* Downstream packages pulling in `plutus-apps` packages via `source-repository-package` stanzas should always take tagged commits.

== Working with the project

=== How to submit an issue

Issues can be filed in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/issues[GitHub Issue tracker].

However, note that this is pre-release software, so we will not usually be providing support.

[[how-to-develop]]
=== How to develop and contribute to the project

See link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING], which describes our processes in more detail including development environments; and link:ARCHITECTURE{outfilesuffix}[ARCHITECTURE], which describes the structure of the repository.

=== How to depend on the project from another Haskell project

None of our libraries are on Hackage, unfortunately (many of our dependencies aren't either).
So for the time being, you need to:

. Add `plutus-apps` as a `source-repository-package` to your `cabal.project`.
. Copy the `source-repository-package` stanzas from our `cabal.project` to yours.
. Copy additional stanzas from our `cabal.project` as you need, e.g. you may need some of the `allow-newer` stanzas.

The https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-starter[plutus-starter] project
(deprecated) provides an example.

== Licensing

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute the Plutus Platform with
under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. See the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE]
and link:./NOTICE[NOTICE] files for details.
