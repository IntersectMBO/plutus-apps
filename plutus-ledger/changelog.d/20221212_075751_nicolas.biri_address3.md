### Added

- `Ledger.Address.CardanoAddress` an alias to address in the latest era
- `Ledger.Address.cardanoAddressCredential` to retrieve `plutus` credentials
  from a Cardano address
- `Ledger.Address.cardanoStakingCredential` to retrieve `plutus` staking credentials
  from a Cardano address
- `Ledger.Address.cardanoStakingCredential` to retrieve `plutus` `PubKeyHash`
  from a Cardano address
- `Ledger.Address.toPlutusAddress` to get a `plutus` address from a Cardano one
  (it replaces `Ledger.Tx.CardanoAPI.fromCardanoAddressInEra`)


### Changed

- `Ledger.Address now priviledges `cardano-api` addresses instead of `plutus-api` addresses.

### Deprecated

- `fromCardanoAddressInEra`, `fromCardanoAddress`, `fromCardanoPaymentCredential`,
  `fromCardanoPaymentKeyHash`, `fromCardanoScriptHash`,
  `fromCardanoStakeAddressReference`and `fromCardanoStakeCredential` from `Ledger.Tx.CardanoAPI`
  that shouldn't be used now that we use `cardano-api` adress in the emulator.
